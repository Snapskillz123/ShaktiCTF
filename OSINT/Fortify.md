# Fortify

A list of forts have been provided for a meeting point for anti-nationals, but all of them are closed.
We know that the leader is in Osaka,Japan and has set a meeting time for 6pm (Probably Japan time) at another fort in maharashtra that we ened to figure out.
Using the website https://testbook.com/mpsc-preparation/forts-in-maharashtra and some trial and error, i found the flag.
